## About

research regarding devices created by [monome](https://monome.org/).

monome-studies includes research about the history behind these devices, their software architecture, their design principles, and also software created for them.

monome-studies is inspired by the open source community surrounding monome, who collaboratively build the [monome documentation](https://monome.org/docs/) and interact on the [llllllll forum](https://monome.org/docs/).

monome-studies is mantained as a open sketchbook, updated frequently and iteratively, riffing off from the original monome documentation, and also contributing to it.

monome-studies is a project by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/), started in 2020, during their work as a research assistant at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/)'s [Opera of the Future](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/overview/) research group.

## Devices

These are the devices by Monome that are studied on this repository.

* [aleph](https://monome.org/docs/aleph/): a computer.
* [ansible](https://monome.org/docs/ansible/): an Eurorack module for interacting with grid, arc, and teletype.
* [arc](https://monome.org/docs/arc/): a controller with knobs.
* [crow](https://monome.org/docs/crow/): an Eurorack scriptable USB-CV-ii machine.
* [grid](https://monome.org/docs/grid/): a controller with lights and keys.
* [meadowphysics](https://monome.org/docs/meadowphysics/): an Eurorack companion to grid, for exploration of polyrhythms and rule-based sequencing.
* [norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/): a computer.
* [teletype](notes/teletype.md): an Eurorack module with connection for USB keyboard, a dynamic, musical event triggering platform.
