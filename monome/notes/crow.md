## About

From the monome documentation available at [https://monome.org/docs/crow/](https://monome.org/docs/crow/):

> crow speaks and listens and remembers bits of text. A scriptable USB-CV-ii machine.
> 
> crow connects to norns and computers running Max, Max for Live, and other serial-enabled applications. We’ve created various norns scripts and Max for Live devices which require no programming, and we’ve also created tutorials and studies to get you started quickly programming your own ideas into this tiny, powerful module.
> 
> crow also stores a complete script, so that without a USB connection it can continue to run, responding to CV input and ii messages.
> 
> A collaboration by Whimsical Raps and monome.

## Installation

From the monome documentation available at [https://monome.org/docs/crow/](https://monome.org/docs/crow/):

> Align the 10-pin ribbon cable so the red stripe corresponds to the white indicator on the rear of the module’s circuit board. This is toward the lower edge of the module.
> 
> If you would like to use the ii functionality, be sure to observe the orientation of the connector. The white stripe indicates GND.
